# Miller Center - Sauti East Africa Customer Segmentation Analysis

## Problem Description
Sauti East Africa, a non-profit social enterprise, focuses on improving the livelihoods of traders and farmers, and particularly women, in East Africa. They provide them with realtime market data through access to online digital resources. Sauti collect demographic data on these traders solutions, but never had a way to visualize the demographic data for researchers.

Sauti has requested our team to perform limited aggregate analysis of all of our user's behavior - on a project evaluation basis. Better understanding our user's interactions will allow Sauti to better optimize their menu design and explore the feasibility of smart menus based on user predicted behavior.

## Databank

Sauti offers a range of information services to users in Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, and Tanzania via a cellular network. Users access these services by dialing a shortcode and navigating through numbered menus. The platform, available in multiple languages, updates hourly with current information covering:

- Market Prices
- Virtual Marketplace
- Currency Exchange Rates
- Weather Forecasts
- Trade and Tax Information
- Financial Management Services
- Agricultural Services
- Business Operations Information
- Legal and Anti-Corruption Information
- COVID-19 Updates

- Corruption Reporting

Sauti aims to bridge information gaps for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), enhancing access to timely information. This addresses challenges like ensuring equal economic opportunities for women-led MSMEs, aiding compliance with trade regulations, promoting transparency to counteract corruption, and improving market efficiency for smaller MSMEs.

## Purpose

Sauti strives to bridge the digital divide by ensuring that our technology- based solutions are accessible to users, including those with limited digital literacy, smartphones, or internet access. This includes USSD and SMS solutions so that anyone, anywhere, with any kind of phone may access the same online resources normally available to smartphone apps and internet-enabled computers.
